"""MultiStudyOrchestrator: concurrent multi-study pipeline engine.

This module provides the :class:`MultiStudyOrchestrator` class, which drives
parallel execution of a user-supplied pipeline function across all active
iMednet study boundaries discovered via the SDK's studies endpoint.

Three-step usage
----------------

1. **Construct** the orchestrator with a live SDK instance::

       orchestrator = MultiStudyOrchestrator(sdk, max_workers=8)

2. **Define** a pipeline callable that conforms to
   :class:`~imednet.orchestration.StudyWorkerCallable`::

       def my_pipeline(study_key, sdk, study_logger, **kwargs):
           study_logger.info("Running pipeline for %s", study_key)
           subjects = sdk.subjects.list(study_key=study_key)
           return {"count": len(list(subjects))}

3. **Execute** and inspect results::

       results = orchestrator.execute_pipeline(
           my_pipeline,
           whitelist={"PROT-01", "PROT-02"},
       )
       for study_key, r in results.items():
           print(study_key, r["status"], r["duration_seconds"])

Each study runs in its own :func:`~imednet.core.context.study_context`,
so context-sensitive SDK calls resolve the correct study automatically.
Per-study failures are captured in the result dict (``status="FAILED"``)
and never propagate as exceptions, ensuring fault isolation.
