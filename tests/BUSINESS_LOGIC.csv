Workflow,GLOSSARY,Disabled,100356,,"KW = Keyword. These are used to flag data conditions for other BLs or reports to use later.
RS = Record Status. These are the icons that represent the current record status. These can be used for report filtration.  Only one can be present on the current record at any given time.
PS = Patient Status. These are the icons that represent the current patient/subject status. These can be used for report filtration.  Only one can be present on the current patient at any given time.
ALL PATIENT-TYPE RECORDS = When you see this in a Workflow BL Intention, please select ONLY records from the Form Manager application that are of the type ""patient"".
ALL RECORDS = When you see this in a Workflow BL Intention, simply select ALL records from the Form Manager application, with the exception of any form designs that are designated as ""Catalog"".
PRIMARY = Records that are intended to go through the study approval workflow. NOT Records which reside in an CEL. When you see this, slow down, and carefully select ONLY the form designs that are meant to achieve an approval.
GRID RECORDS = Forms that exist within a dynamic grid on the Patient Record Page. These do NOT include CELs on the parent forms. When you see this, slow down, and carefully select ONLY the form designs that exist within the associated grid in Interval Manager.
EL = An Embedded Log is an object that can be added to a form design that can either display CEL or Primary records. The EL concept is to create a click to add data entry scenario of a specific dataset when viewing another record.  See below for CEL and IEL.
CEL = Child Embedded Log. A type of EL that can allow the user to create related records from the current record while maintaining a direct relationship through the dataset, where the child will always call-out the parent record_id from where it was created. A good example of this might be a CEL that resides within a Procedure Form. The CEL might be the ability to add Stent Information related to the Procedure. These CEL records will now only be able to be viewed in this context as a log record/row within the Procedure form. The CEL records will reference the parent record_id within the CEL dataset. The CEL Stent records will be able to affect the parent Procedure record status. CEL records will typically NOT be a part of the approval process as they will be considered part of a semblance of a collective whole (in the Procedure record).
IEL = Independent Embedded Log. A type of Log that allows data entry of another record that is UNRELATED to the record which the Log is displaying within. Records used in IELs are typically expected to go through the approval process. Any record (row) of the Log will NOT have a reference to the record it is displaying within as a log row. Records the are included in an IEL can be viewed outside of the IEL if a user has access to a link from a report, in which case, the user will be taken to that record only, and not the Log format.
LOG HOLDER = Placeholder record that displays an Independent Embedded Log (IEL) for the end user.  The log record here achieves a blue record status and does not go through the record workflow where the PRIMARY records within the IEL typically would.
BL TRIGGERED RECORDS = This is a reference to records that are set within a manually created Form BL to trigger for example, a Protocol Deviation record for completion.
EMAIL - This is in any BL name or intent that triggers an Email Notification or is related to the Email Notification trigger criteria.
PVI - Populate Visit Interval.
CATALOG = A catalog is a form design used for Inventory or a true lookup type catalog & is NOT a data entry record.  These are outside the scope of record workflow.
""Form"" vs ""Record"" terminology = A ""Form"" is design mode. A ""Form"" becomes a ""Record"" when used in data entry. In other words, a Designer will create a form for a study. A Data Entry user will have ""Forms"" available to them. A saved ""Form"" becomes a ""Record"".  For support, or troubleshooting, it is advantageous to distinguish between the two for the sake of clarity.",99999,,"12-08-2014 20:25:52","Evan Pape","03-12-2021 13:19:01",4,,,,,,
