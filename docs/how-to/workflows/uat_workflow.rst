UAT Workflow Guide
==================

The UAT (User Acceptance Testing) workflow automates the end-to-end process of inspecting a study, generating a test specification, producing synthetic test records, submitting them to the API, and monitoring the asynchronous jobs until completion.

Visual Workflow
---------------

The following diagram illustrates the internal orchestration logic of the UAT workflow:

        participant User
        participant Orchestrator as UATWorkflow
        participant Inspector as StudySchemaInspector
        participant Builder as UATSpecificationBuilder
        participant Generator as SyntheticRecordGenerator
        participant Submitter as BulkRecordSubmissionWorkflow
        participant Poller as PollingManager

        User->>Orchestrator: run("STUDY_KEY")
        Orchestrator->>Inspector: inspect("STUDY_KEY")
        Inspector-->>Orchestrator: StudySnapshot
        Orchestrator->>Builder: build(StudySnapshot)
        Builder-->>Orchestrator: UATSpecification
        Orchestrator->>Generator: generate(UATSpecification, StudySnapshot)
        Generator-->>Orchestrator: List[GeneratedRecordSet]
        Orchestrator->>Submitter: submit("STUDY_KEY", List[GeneratedRecordSet])
        Submitter-->>Orchestrator: SubmissionResult (with Job IDs)
        Orchestrator->>Poller: monitor(Job IDs)
        Poller-->>Orchestrator: UATRunResult (Pass/Fail)
        Orchestrator-->>User: UATRunResult

Usage Example
-------------

The following code demonstrates how to use the ``UATWorkflow`` to automate test validation:

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/workflow_uat.py
   :language: python

Detailed Steps
--------------

1. **Inspection:** The workflow starts by fetching the current study design (forms, variables, sites) to build a ``StudySnapshot``.
2. **Specification Building:** A specification is created that maps out exactly which tests (e.g., ``REGISTER_SUBJECT``, ``CREATE_NEW_RECORD``) need to be run against which forms.
3. **Generation:** Synthetic data payloads are generated to fulfill the specification.
4. **Submission:** The data is pushed to the API using the bulk submission workflow.
5. **Monitoring:** Finally, the orchestrator polls the job endpoints until all batches are either COMPLETED or FAILED, generating a detailed summary.
