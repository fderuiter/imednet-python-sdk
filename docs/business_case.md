# Business Case for imednet-python-sdk

## 1. Executive Summary

Building a dedicated Python SDK for the imednet REST API delivers a structured, type‑safe, and documented interface that accelerates development, reduces bugs, and ensures long‑term maintainability compared to ad hoc HTTP calls.

## 2. Problem Statement

• Direct REST integrations require repetitive boilerplate code (URL construction, headers, error parsing).  
• Lack of unified error handling leads to inconsistent exception flows.  
• Manually handling pagination, retries, and authentication is time consuming and error prone.  
• No centralized models or validation means silent data issues and format mismatches.  
• Poor discoverability: developers must reference external docs and string literals in code.

## 3. Proposed Solution

Deliver a first‑class Python SDK with:

- A core HTTP client encapsulating requests, retries, and timeouts  
- Typed data models (Pydantic/dataclasses) with built‑in validation  
- Resource‑specific clients mapping each endpoint to intuitive methods  
- Centralized authentication workflows (API key, OAuth2) and token management  
- Transparent pagination iterators and retry logic  
- Consistent exceptions with context and error payloads  
- Full documentation, examples, and automated tests

## 4. Key Benefits

- **Developer Productivity**: Focus on business logic, not HTTP details.  
- **Reliability**: Automatic retries and standardized error handling reduce runtime failures.  
- **Maintainability**: Centralized client and models ease upgrades when the API evolves.  
- **Quality**: Type hints, validation, and linting catch errors early.  
- **Discoverability**: IDE auto‑completion and in‑code documentation streamline onboarding.  
- **Governance & Compliance**: Versioning and distribution via PyPI support controlled releases.

## 5. Conclusion

Investing in the imednet‑python‑sdk significantly lowers integration effort and total cost of ownership for any Python consumer of the imednet REST API. It sets a best‑practice standard for consistent, reliable, and maintainable API usage across projects.
