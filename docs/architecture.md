# High-Level Architecture of the imednet-python-sdk

## Overview
The imednet-python-sdk is designed to provide a seamless interface for interacting with the imednet REST API. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy maintenance and extensibility. The SDK is structured into several key components, each responsible for specific functionalities.

## Main Components

1. **ImednetClient**
   - Located in `src/imednet_sdk/client.py`
   - This is the core class responsible for making API requests. It includes methods for HTTP operations: `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`. The client handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.

2. **API Module**
   - Located in `src/imednet_sdk/api/`
   - This module contains classes and functions that correspond to specific API endpoints. Each endpoint can be encapsulated in its own class, providing a clear structure for managing different parts of the API.

3. **Models Module**
   - Located in `src/imednet_sdk/models/`
   - This module defines data models and schemas used throughout the SDK. It ensures that data structures are consistent and can be easily validated before sending requests or processing responses.

4. **Utilities**
   - Located in `src/imednet_sdk/utils.py`
   - This file contains helper functions for tasks such as data validation, logging, and formatting. Utilities promote code reuse and keep the main components clean and focused on their primary responsibilities.

## Relationships Between Components
- The `ImednetClient` serves as the entry point for users of the SDK. It interacts with the API module to perform operations based on user requests.
- The API module utilizes the models defined in the Models module to ensure that the data being sent and received adheres to the expected formats.
- Utility functions are called by both the `ImednetClient` and the API module to handle common tasks, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach.

## Conclusion
The architecture of the imednet-python-sdk is designed to be intuitive and modular, facilitating easy interaction with the imednet REST API. By separating concerns into distinct components, the SDK remains maintainable and adaptable to future changes in the API or additional features.
