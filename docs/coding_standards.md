# Coding Standards for imednet-python-sdk

## General Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable, function, and class names that clearly describe their purpose.
- Keep lines of code to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside brackets.

## Documentation
- Each module, class, and function should have a docstring that describes its purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Use reStructuredText format for docstrings to maintain consistency and compatibility with documentation generators.

## Comments
- Use comments to explain complex logic or decisions in the code.
- Avoid obvious comments that do not add value to the understanding of the code.

## Version Control
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive, following the format: "Type: Short description".
- Types include: `Feature`, `Fix`, `Refactor`, `Documentation`, etc.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all public methods and classes.
- Use descriptive names for test functions to indicate what they are testing.
- Ensure that tests are organized and follow a consistent naming convention.

## Code Reviews
- All code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the main branch.
- Provide constructive feedback during code reviews, focusing on code quality, readability, and adherence to standards.

## Dependencies
- Manage dependencies using `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Regularly update dependencies to keep the project secure and up-to-date.

## Error Handling
- Use exceptions to handle errors gracefully.
- Provide meaningful error messages that can help in debugging.

## Performance
- Write efficient code, considering time and space complexity.
- Profile and optimize code as necessary, especially in performance-critical sections.

## Security
- Be mindful of security best practices, especially when handling sensitive data.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

By adhering to these coding standards, we can ensure that the imednet-python-sdk remains maintainable, readable, and efficient.
