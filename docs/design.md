# Detailed Design of the imednet-python-sdk

## Overview
The imednet-python-sdk is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the imednet REST API. The SDK abstracts the complexities of making HTTP requests and handling responses, allowing developers to focus on building their applications.

## Components

### 1. ImednetClient
- **Location**: `src/imednet_sdk/client.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles API requests and responses.
  - Provides methods for HTTP operations: `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`.
  - Manages authentication and session handling.

### 2. API Module
- **Location**: `src/imednet_sdk/api/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Contains classes or functions for specific API endpoints.
  - Encapsulates the logic for interacting with different parts of the imednet API.
  - Ensures that the SDK adheres to the API's structure and requirements.

### 3. Models Module
- **Location**: `src/imednet_sdk/models/`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Defines data models or schemas used in the SDK.
  - Provides validation and serialization/deserialization of data.
  - Ensures that data structures align with the API's expectations.

### 4. Utilities
- **Location**: `src/imednet_sdk/utils.py`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Contains helper functions for tasks such as data validation, formatting, and logging.
  - Provides reusable code that can be utilized across different components of the SDK.

## Interaction Flow
1. **Client Initialization**: The user initializes the `ImednetClient` with necessary configuration (e.g., API key, base URL).
2. **API Calls**: The user calls methods on the `ImednetClient` to perform operations (e.g., fetching data, submitting forms).
3. **Endpoint Handling**: The client routes the request to the appropriate API endpoint class/function.
4. **Response Processing**: The response is processed, and data models are populated as needed.
5. **Return Data**: The processed data is returned to the user in a structured format.

## Error Handling
- The SDK will implement robust error handling to manage API errors, network issues, and data validation failures.
- Custom exceptions will be defined to provide meaningful error messages to the user.

## Testing
- Unit tests will be implemented for the `ImednetClient` and other components to ensure functionality and reliability.
- Mocking will be used to simulate API responses during testing.

## Conclusion
The design of the imednet-python-sdk aims to provide a clean, efficient, and user-friendly interface for developers to interact with the imednet REST API. By encapsulating the complexities of API interactions, the SDK will facilitate faster development and integration of imednet services into applications.
