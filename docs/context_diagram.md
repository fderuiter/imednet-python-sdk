# System Context Diagram for imednet-python-sdk

## Overview
The System Context Diagram illustrates the interactions between the imednet-python-sdk and external entities, including users and external systems. It provides a high-level view of how the SDK fits into the broader ecosystem.

## Diagram Description
- **Users**: Individuals or applications that utilize the SDK to interact with the imednet REST API.
- **Imednet REST API**: The external API that the SDK communicates with to perform various operations such as retrieving data, submitting requests, and managing resources.
- **Imednet Python SDK**: The core component that acts as an intermediary between the users and the Imednet REST API, encapsulating the API's functionality in a Pythonic way.

## Key Interactions
1. **Users to SDK**: Users send requests to the SDK to perform operations such as fetching data or submitting information.
2. **SDK to REST API**: The SDK translates user requests into API calls, handling authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.
3. **REST API to SDK**: The API responds to the SDK with data or status messages, which the SDK processes and returns to the users.
