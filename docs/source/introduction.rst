Introduction
============

Welcome to the `imednet-python-sdk`! This library provides a convenient Python interface for interacting with the iMednet REST API.

Its goal is to simplify the process of integrating iMednet functionalities into your Python applications by providing:

*   An easy-to-use client for making API requests.
*   Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
*   Clear handling of authentication and API responses.

Whether you need to manage studies, sites, subjects, records, or other iMednet resources, this SDK aims to provide a robust and developer-friendly experience.

See the :doc:`installation` guide to get started, and the :doc:`quickstart` for a basic usage example.
