# Task 5: Resource Endpoint Implementations

- Implement individual clients for each API resource (e.g., SitesClient, StudiesClient, SubjectsClient, VisitsClient, VariablesClient, RecordsClient, JobsClient, UsersClient)
- Map each endpoint (CRUD operations) to client methods
- Consistently handle URL path parameters and query parameters
- Ensure methods return typed model objects
