Live Test Charter
=================

This document is the authoritative contract for all live test code in this
repository. It defines the purpose of the smoke path and ``tests/live``,
the mutation policy, environment prerequisites, discovery rules,
pass/skip/fail semantics, observability expectations, and a maintainer
runbook for interpreting results.

Every implementation issue that touches smoke or live testing should be
evaluated against this charter.

----

1. Purpose
----------

Smoke path (``scripts/post_smoke_record.py``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The smoke script proves **authentication, connectivity, and the write path**
against a live iMednet environment.

A successful smoke run means:

* valid credentials were accepted by the API,
* at least one study and one form were discovered or explicitly configured,
* at least one record was submitted and the resulting job reached ``COMPLETED``
  status within the configured timeout.

The smoke script is the fastest signal that the environment is ready before
running the broader live suite.  It is the appropriate target for nightly
schedules or on-demand readiness checks.

``tests/live`` pytest suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The live pytest suite provides **regression coverage of representative user
journeys** across every supported API surface.  It is not intended to cover
every permutation of every endpoint; it is intended to prove that each major
resource type and workflow can be reached and returns well-formed data.

A healthy live suite run means:

* every endpoint that is accessible in the configured environment returned
  expected model types,
* mutation scenarios ran when ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION=1`` and produced
  completed jobs,
* no test failed due to a defect in the SDK; skipped tests have explicit,
  documented reasons.

----

2. Scope
--------

The live suite covers:

* all ``list`` and ``get`` operations for every endpoint,
* record creation and job polling (when mutation is enabled),
* CLI commands via ``typer.testing.CliRunner``,
* export helpers (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, SQL),
* Airflow hook and operator integration (when Airflow is installed),
* workflow utilities (extract, register, update) when mutation is enabled.

Breadth of coverage is preferred over depth.  Each resource type needs at
least one live test.  Deep parametric tests for edge cases belong in the unit
suite.

----

3. Mutation policy
------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 15 50

   * - Coverage area
     - Read-only
     - Mutating (requires ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION=1``)
   * - ``studies.list`` / ``studies.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``sites.list`` / ``sites.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``subjects.list`` / ``subjects.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``records.list`` / ``records.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``forms.list`` / ``forms.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``intervals.list`` / ``intervals.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``visits.list`` / ``visits.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``variables.list``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``queries.list``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``record_revisions.list``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``users.list``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``codings.list``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``jobs.get``
     - ✓
     -
   * - ``records.create``
     -
     - ✓
   * - ``poll_job``
     -
     - ✓
   * - ``RecordUpdateWorkflow`` (all methods)
     -
     - ✓
   * - ``RegisterSubjectsWorkflow.register_subjects``
     -
     - ✓
   * - Smoke ``post_smoke_record.py``
     -
     - ✓ (always mutates)

**Rules:**

* Read-only tests must always pass when credentials are valid and the
  environment contains at least one study.
* Mutating tests skip automatically when ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION`` is not
  set to ``1``.  Missing the variable is never a failure.
* The smoke script always mutates.  Running it against a production study
  without intent is an operator error, not a code defect.
* Mutation tests are responsible for their own cleanup.  No cleanup helpers
  are required, but tests must not assume data they create persists across
  runs.

----

4. Environment prerequisites
----------------------------

Required variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 50 20

   * - Variable
     - Description
     - Required
   * - ``IMEDNET_API_KEY``
     - API key for authentication.
     - Always
   * - ``IMEDNET_SECURITY_KEY``
     - Security key for authentication.
     - Always
   * - ``IMEDNET_RUN_E2E``
     - Must be ``1`` to enable any live test.
     - Always
   * - ``IMEDNET_BASE_URL``
     - Override the default API base URL.
     - Optional
   * - ``IMEDNET_STUDY_KEY``
     - Pin a specific study instead of auto-discovery.
     - Optional
   * - ``IMEDNET_FORM_KEY``
     - Pin a specific form instead of auto-discovery.
     - Optional
   * - ``IMEDNET_BATCH_ID``
     - Supply a known batch ID for job-polling tests.
     - Optional
   * - ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION``
     - Set to ``1`` to enable write-path tests.
     - Optional

Minimum environment state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configured study must contain:

* at least one form with ``subject_record_report=true`` and ``disabled=false``
  for mutation tests,
* at least one site for site-listing tests; an active site is required for
  registration scenarios,
* at least one subject for subject-listing tests; an active subject is
  required for write scenarios,
* at least one non-disabled interval for interval-listing tests; a non-disabled
  interval is required for scheduled-visit scenarios.

Tests that require these entities **skip** when they are absent.  Absence is
treated as environment drift, not a code defect.  A failed API call
(network error, ``5xx``, ``4xx``) is always a test failure.

Acceptable status values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table documents which statuses are treated as eligible.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 40 40

   * - Entity
     - Eligible for reads
     - Eligible for writes
   * - Study
     - any (first returned)
     - same
   * - Form
     - ``subject_record_report=true``, ``disabled=false``
     - same
   * - Site
     - any (first returned)
     - ``site_enrollment_status`` equals ``active`` or ``enrollment_open``
       (case-insensitive)
   * - Subject
     - any (first returned)
     - ``subject_status`` equals ``active``, ``registered``, ``baseline``, or
       ``enrolled`` (case-insensitive)
   * - Interval
     - ``disabled=false``
     - same

Status checks are **case-insensitive equality checks**, not substring matches.
This prevents false rejections when server environments use values like
``"Active"`` or ``"ACTIVE"``, while avoiding false positives from statuses
like ``"Inactive"`` or ``"Deactivated"``.

----

5. Discovery rules
------------------

Discovery is the process by which live tests locate the identifiers they need.
The rules are applied in the following priority order:

1. **Explicit environment variable** — if ``IMEDNET_STUDY_KEY`` (or
   ``IMEDNET_FORM_KEY``) is set, it is used without validation against the live
   environment.  The operator is responsible for correctness.
2. **Auto-discovery** — the discovery module queries the API and selects the
   first entity that satisfies the eligibility criteria in the table above.
3. **Skip** — if auto-discovery finds no eligible entity, the test skips with a
   message that names the missing entity.

Discovery **never fails a test** on its own.  A test fails only when the API
returns an error during discovery or when an assertion on the returned data
fails.

Capability-based selection means the eligibility criteria are evaluated on
observable attributes (``disabled``, ``subject_record_report``, status fields)
rather than on hard-coded status strings.  The ``imednet.discovery`` module
implements this contract.

----

6. Pass / skip / fail semantics
--------------------------------

Smoke (``scripts/post_smoke_record.py``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 20 50

   * - Condition
     - Outcome
     - Meaning
   * - Credentials valid, study found, record submitted, job ``COMPLETED``
     - **Green** (exit 0)
     - The environment is reachable and the write path works.
   * - Credentials valid, study or form found, but no identifiers available for
       any write scenario
     - **Skip** (exit 0 + ``::notice::`` annotation)
     - The environment exists but is not configured for writes.  This is a
       warning, not a failure.
   * - Credentials valid, no studies or no eligible form found
     - **Red** (exit 1)
     - The environment has no accessible data; the smoke run cannot prove
       anything.
   * - Job did not reach ``COMPLETED`` within the timeout
     - **Red** (exit 1)
     - Record submission failed or is stuck.
   * - Authentication error, network error, or unhandled exception
     - **Red** (exit 1)
     - The environment is unreachable or credentials are wrong.

``tests/live`` pytest suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 35 15 50

   * - Condition
     - Outcome
     - Meaning
   * - ``IMEDNET_RUN_E2E`` not ``1`` or credentials absent
     - **Skip** (whole suite)
     - Live tests are not enabled.  This is the expected default in CI
       without live secrets.
   * - Discovery finds no eligible entity for this test
     - **Skip** (single test)
     - The environment does not have the data this test needs.  Not a code
       defect.
   * - ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION`` not set and test requires mutation
     - **Skip** (single test)
     - Mutation is not permitted in this run.  Not a defect.
   * - Optional dependency (``openpyxl``, ``pyarrow``, etc.) not installed
     - **Skip** (single test)
     - The optional integration is not available in this environment.
   * - API call returns a successful response and assertions pass
     - **Pass**
     - The SDK behaves correctly against the live server.
   * - API call returns a ``4xx`` or ``5xx`` response
     - **Fail**
     - The server rejected a valid request or returned an error.
   * - Network error, timeout, or connection refused
     - **Fail**
     - Infrastructure problem; the harness is misconfigured or the
       environment is down.
   * - Assertion on returned data fails
     - **Fail**
     - A code defect or schema mismatch was detected.

A **green** run means every non-skipped test passed.  A run with only
expected skips (no eligible data, mutation disabled, optional deps absent)
is also considered green.

A run that is **entirely skipped** because ``IMEDNET_RUN_E2E`` is not set is
not a signal about environment health; it simply means the run did not
execute.

A run with **any failure** indicates a real problem: a code defect, an API
change, or an infrastructure issue.

----

7. Observability expectations
------------------------------

At startup, ``tests/live/conftest.py`` prints the following context:

* whether ``IMEDNET_RUN_E2E`` is set,
* whether ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION`` is set,
* the value of ``IMEDNET_STUDY_KEY`` (if set, or ``auto-discover`` otherwise),
* the resolved base URL.

This output is always visible, even when tests are subsequently skipped.  It
lets operators verify that the right environment was targeted before reading
individual test outcomes.

When a test is skipped due to missing data, the skip message must:

* name the specific entity that was not found (e.g. ``"No active sites for
  study ABC123"``),
* not mention credentials or other unrelated context.

When a test fails, the failure message must:

* include the HTTP status code and response body when an API error occurred,
* include the assertion that failed and the actual value returned.

Warnings emitted during a live run should be suppressed or redirected to a
log file unless they originate from the SDK itself.

----

8. Maintainer runbook
---------------------

Interpreting smoke results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Green exit (0)
   The write path is confirmed.  Record creation completed within the
   timeout.  Safe to proceed to the full live suite.

Green exit (0) with ``::notice::`` annotations
   Authentication succeeded but some identifiers (site, subject, or
   interval) were not available.  Fewer scenarios were tested.  Check
   whether the study is correctly populated.

Red exit (1) — ``NoLiveDataError``
   No study or form was discoverable.  Check that valid credentials point
   to an environment with at least one study and one subject-record form.

Red exit (1) — timeout or ``COMPLETED`` not reached
   Record submission succeeded (job was created) but the job did not
   finish.  This may indicate server-side processing latency.  Try
   ``--timeout`` with a larger value.  If it persists, check server logs.

Red exit (1) — authentication error
   ``IMEDNET_API_KEY`` or ``IMEDNET_SECURITY_KEY`` is wrong or expired.

Interpreting live pytest results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All tests skipped (``IMEDNET_RUN_E2E`` absent)
   Not a live run.  Expected in standard CI.

Tests skipped with data-absence messages
   The environment exists but lacks the required entities.  This is
   environment drift, not a code defect.  Populate the study or check that
   ``IMEDNET_STUDY_KEY`` points to a prepared study.

Mutation tests skipped
   ``IMEDNET_ALLOW_MUTATION=1`` was not set.  Intentional.

Tests failed with ``4xx`` or ``5xx`` errors
   The server rejected a request.  Check:

   1. Whether the API surface changed (compare SDK models against API docs).
   2. Whether the study key is valid and accessible.
   3. Whether a required environment entity changed status or was deleted.

Tests failed with network errors
   The host is unreachable.  Check ``IMEDNET_BASE_URL`` and network access.

Tests failed with assertion errors
   A code defect.  The SDK returned data that did not match the expected
   model or value.  Open a bug issue.

Determining the cause of a "no eligible data" skip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the smoke script first with ``--verbose``.  It prints the discovered
study key, form key, site, subject, and interval.  If any are missing, the
relevant entity must be created or activated in the target study before the
live suite can cover that scenario.

Keeping the charter current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update this document when:

* a new endpoint or resource type is added,
* the mutation policy changes (e.g., cleanup is added),
* new environment variables are introduced,
* skip or fail semantics are intentionally changed.

The charter is the single source of truth for what a live run means.  Code
changes that alter live test behavior without updating this document should
be rejected in review.
