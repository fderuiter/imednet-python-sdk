"""Placeholder for a Subject Data Retrieval workflow."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides a higher-level workflow to retrieve comprehensive data
# related to a specific subject within a study.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `SubjectDataWorkflow`.
# 2. This class should accept the main SDK instance or the necessary endpoint instances
#    (e.g., Subjects, Visits, Records) during initialization.
# 3. Implement a method like `get_all_subject_data(study_key, subject_key)`.
# 4. This method will orchestrate calls to various endpoints:
#    a. Use `sdk.subjects.get_list` (or a future `get_by_key`) to fetch subject details.
#    b. Use `sdk.visits.get_list` filtered by `subject_key` to get all visits for the subject.
#    c. Use `sdk.records.get_list` filtered by `subject_key` (and potentially visit/form)
#        to get all records.
#    d. Potentially fetch related queries using `sdk.queries.get_list` filtered by `subject_key`.
#    e. Aggregate and structure the retrieved data into a meaningful representation
#       (e.g., a dictionary or a custom Pydantic model containing subject info,
#       visits, records, queries).
#    f. Handle pagination if necessary when calling list endpoints.
#    g. Return the aggregated subject data.

# Integration:
# - This module could be imported and used directly or accessed via the main SDK class
#   if helper methods are added there
#       (e.g., `sdk.workflows.subject_data.get_all_subject_data(...)`).
# - It simplifies common tasks by abstracting away the need to call multiple individual endpoints.
