"""Placeholder for Data Extraction workflows."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides flexible workflows for extracting specific datasets from a study,
# potentially combining data from multiple endpoints based on criteria.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `DataExtractionWorkflow`.
# 2. This class should accept the main SDK instance or relevant endpoint instances.
# 3. Implement methods for targeted data extraction:
#    a. `extract_records_by_criteria(study_key, record_filter=None, subject_filter=None,
#           visit_filter=None, **other_filters)`:
#       - This method would intelligently query relevant endpoints (Subjects, Visits, Records)
#         based on the provided filters.
#       - It might first fetch subjects matching `subject_filter`,
#         then visits matching `visit_filter`
#         for those subjects, and finally records matching `record_filter`
#         for those visits/subjects.
#       - It needs to handle pagination across multiple endpoint calls.
#       - Returns a structured dataset (e.g., list of records with associated subject/visit info).
#    b. `extract_audit_trail(study_key, start_date=None,
#           end_date=None, user_filter=None, **filters)`:
#       - Uses `sdk.record_revisions.get_list` with appropriate date and user filters.
#       - Handles pagination.
#       - Returns a list of RecordRevision objects.

# Integration:
# - Accessed via the main SDK instance
#       (e.g., `sdk.workflows.data_extraction.extract_records_by_criteria(...)`).
# - Offers powerful data retrieval capabilities beyond single endpoint calls.
