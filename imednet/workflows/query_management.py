"""Placeholder for Query Management workflows."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides workflows related to managing queries within a study,
# such as finding open queries or queries for specific subjects/sites.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `QueryManagementWorkflow`.
# 2. This class should accept the main SDK instance or the `QueriesEndpoint` instance.
# 3. Implement methods for common query-related tasks:
#    a. `get_open_queries(study_key, **filters)`: Uses `sdk.queries.get_list`
#       with a filter for open statuses.
#    b. `get_queries_for_subject(study_key, subject_key, **filters)`:
#       Uses `sdk.queries.get_list` filtered by subject.
#    c. `get_queries_by_site(study_key, site_key, **filters)`:
#       Uses `sdk.queries.get_list` filtered by site.
#    d. These methods would handle pagination and return lists of Query objects.
# 4. Consider adding methods to analyze query data (e.g., count queries by status).

# Integration:
# - Accessed via the main SDK instance
#       (e.g., `sdk.workflows.query_management.get_open_queries(...)`).
# - Provides convenient ways to access query information without manually constructing
#   complex filters.
