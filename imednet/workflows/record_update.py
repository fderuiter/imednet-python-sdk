"""Placeholder for Record Creation/Update workflows."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides workflows for creating or updating records, potentially handling
# dependencies or batching operations.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `RecordUpdateWorkflow`.
# 2. This class should accept the main SDK instance or the `RecordsEndpoint` and `JobsEndpoint`
# instances.
# 3. Implement methods for streamlined record updates:
#    a. `submit_record_batch(study_key, records_data, wait_for_completion=False, timeout=300)`:
#       - Takes a list of record data objects.
#       - Calls `sdk.records.create` to submit the batch.
#       - If `wait_for_completion` is True:
#         - Retrieves the `batch_id` from the response.
#         - Polls `sdk.jobs.get_status` periodically until the job is complete or timeout occurs.
#         - Returns the final job status.
#       - Otherwise, returns the initial job status immediately.
#    b. Potentially add methods to simplify creating specific record
#       structures based on form/variable definitions.

# Integration:
# - Accessed via the main SDK instance
#       (e.g., `sdk.workflows.record_update.submit_record_batch(...)`).
# - Simplifies the process of submitting data and optionally monitoring the asynchronous job.
