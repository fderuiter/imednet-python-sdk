"""Placeholder for the Jobs endpoint."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides functionality to interact with the Jobs endpoint
# of the Mednet EDC REST API. It allows retrieving the status and details of a specific job
# initiated by a POST request to the Records endpoint.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `JobsEndpoint`.
# 2. This class should accept the core API client instance during initialization
#    to handle making the actual HTTP requests.
# 3. Implement a method like `get_status(study_key, batch_id)`
#    corresponding to the GET request for this endpoint.
# 4. This method will:
#    a. Construct the correct API path: /api/v1/edc/studies/{study_key}/jobs/{batch_id}.
#    b. Call the `client.get` method on the core client, passing the path.
#    d. Handle potential API errors returned by the client.
#    e. Deserialize the JSON response into an appropriate Pydantic model (e.g., a JobStatus model).
#    f. Return the deserialized data.

# Integration:
# - This module will be imported and used by the main SDK class (`imednet.sdk.MednetSdk`).
# - The SDK class will instantiate this endpoint class, passing the configured core client.
# - Users of the SDK will access the endpoint methods through the SDK instance
#   (e.g., `sdk.jobs.get_status(...)`).
