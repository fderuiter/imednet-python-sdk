"""Placeholder for the Studies endpoint."""

# Purpose:
# This module provides functionality to interact with the Studies endpoint
# of the Mednet EDC REST API. It allows retrieving the set of studies accessible via the API key.

# Implementation:
# 1. Define a class, perhaps named `StudiesEndpoint`.
# 2. This class should accept the core API client instance during initialization
#    to handle making the actual HTTP requests.
# 3. Implement a method like `get_list(page=0, size=25, sort=None, filter=None)`
#    corresponding to the GET request for this endpoint.
# 4. This method will:
#    a. Construct the correct API path: /api/v1/edc/studies.
#    b. Prepare request parameters (query params: page, size, sort, filter).
#    c. Call the `client.get` method on the core client, passing the path and parameters.
#    d. Handle potential API errors returned by the client.
#    e. Deserialize the JSON response into appropriate Pydantic models
#       (e.g., a pagination model containing Study items).
#    f. Return the deserialized data.

# Integration:
# - This module will be imported and used by the main SDK class (`imednet.sdk.MednetSdk`).
# - The SDK class will instantiate this endpoint class, passing the configured core client.
# - Users of the SDK will access the endpoint methods through the SDK instance
#   (e.g., `sdk.studies.get_list(...)`).
