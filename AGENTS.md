# AGENTS.md — Contributor Guide

**Note:** This file contains strict instructions for AI agents and human contributors working in this directory and its subdirectories.

1. **Stack & Rules**: You MUST follow the dependency stack rules and immutable constraints (credential handling, testing boundaries, PR guidelines) defined in `docs/reference/agent_rules.rst`.
2. **Verification**: You MUST execute the full CI quality gate locally before proposing a solution, as detailed in `docs/how-to/verification.rst`.
3. **Architecture**: You MUST adhere to the separation of concerns defined in `docs/explanation/architecture.rst`.
