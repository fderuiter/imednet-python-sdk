- Fixed export helpers to cast DataFrame column names to strings before
  case-insensitive de-duplication.
- Imported Airflow hooks at runtime in export operator to simplify mocking.
- Guarded Airflow hook against non-string connection extras and ensured sensors module is importable for reloading.
- Narrowed subject existence validation in `RegisterSubjectsWorkflow` to catch only `ApiError` and `ValueError`.
- Updated smoke workflow to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4`.
- Added tests for JsonModel type normalization.
- Added tests for deprecated `imednet.airflow` shim ensuring warning and re-exports.
- Expanded AGENTS contributor guides with scoped templates across packages and tooling.

- Smoke workflow now uploads verbose script logs and runs live tests with full output.
- Refined contributor guides: mapped project scope, Python 3.10â€“3.12 support, and
  unified validation for ruff, black, isort, mypy, and pytest across docs,
  tests, examples, and workflows.
- CLI now closes the SDK after each command to free resources and avoid
  interrupt-driven exit codes in repeated invocations.
- Fixed generated batch fixture in live tests to submit valid record data by
    populating required variables, ensuring CLI job polling succeeds.

- Added helpers for live tests and smoke script to auto-discover study and form
  keys, removing the `IMEDNET_FORM_KEY` override.

  updated the smoke record script to use them.
- Smoke record script now validates site and subject availability before posting
  records.
- Form discovery now skips disabled and non-subject forms to avoid invalid form
  key errors during record creation.

  record dictionary construction.
- Smoke test script accepts a configurable `--timeout` and reports detailed

  obtain a batch ID, removing the need for `IMEDNET_FORM_KEY` and
  `IMEDNET_BATCH_ID` secrets.
- Extended smoke test job polling timeout to 90 seconds.
- Renamed ``models._base`` to ``models.json_base`` to avoid import confusion.

- Documented Sphinx conventions in new `docs/AGENTS.md`.
- Added smoke workflow for live API tests.
- Documented optional `smoke.yml` workflow which uses `APIKEY` and `SECURITYKEY` to run `tests/live`.

- Ensured live schema validation tests verify the schema is populated to avoid
  false negatives when the server returns an empty schema.
- ``validate_record_data`` now raises ``ValidationError`` when provided an unknown form key.
- Record submission now checks form existence after schema refresh and raises
  ``ValueError`` for unknown form keys.
- Added ``DataDictionaryLoader`` for loading data dictionaries from CSV files or ZIP archives.
